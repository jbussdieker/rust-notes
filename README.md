Rust packages are called crates. There are 2 types of crates:
  Binary crate
  Library crate

Variables are by default immutable but adding `mut` to the declaration will make them mutable

Variables passed to functions default to byval but can be passed byref using `&variablename`
	This makes an immutable reference but using  `&mut variable name` we can get a mutable reference to the variable

Associated or static methods are referenced by `::`â€¨
Lines are terminated using `;`

Most functions return a `Result` enumeration to indicate success or failure and provide the returned value

Macros are called using `macroname!` where the `!` differentiates it from a normal method call

The standard library does not support random number generation but there is a `rand` crate available
